Hi Jaime,

Thank you for your email.

I found an easier way to make the payment, as shown in the screenshot below, rather than using the method you suggested. 

The payment options appeared after I completed step 1 (name, email, phone, address).

Instead of making three separate payments, I only need to make a single payment for all three transactions, which means there will be just one international charge as well. 

So, I will proceed with this method instead.

Thank you.
