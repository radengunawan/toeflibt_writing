Certainly! Here are examples of improper or incorrect use for each term, along with explanations of why they are incorrect:

### 1. **Thereby**
**Incorrect Usage:**  
- **Sentence:** "She finished the book thereby."
- **Explanation:** This sentence is incorrect because "thereby" is used to indicate the result of an action, but in this sentence, there is no clear cause-and-effect relationship. "Thereby" doesn’t fit here because there’s no subsequent result being described.

**Incorrect Usage:**  
- **Sentence:** "He missed the bus, thereby he was late."
- **Explanation:** This is incorrect due to the sentence structure. "Thereby" is typically used within the same clause or closely linked to the cause. A comma and conjunction ("so," "and," etc.) would be more appropriate: "He missed the bus, so he was late."

### 2. **Opt in**
**Incorrect Usage:**  
- **Sentence:** "You can opt in the meeting tomorrow."
- **Explanation:** This is incorrect because "opt in" should be followed by the preposition "to" or "for" when referring to a specific action or event. The correct phrase would be "opt in to the meeting tomorrow" or "opt in for the meeting tomorrow."

**Incorrect Usage:**  
- **Sentence:** "They opted in automatically."
- **Explanation:** "Opt in" implies a deliberate choice, so it cannot be used to describe something that happens automatically. A correct version would be, "They were automatically enrolled," or "They had to manually opt in."

These examples show how improper use of these terms can lead to confusion or incorrect meanings.
