IMPROPER USAGE and the FIX:

### 1. Structure Issue
   - Incorrect: "The profits of our company are higher than that of last year."
   - Correct: "The profits of our company are higher than those of last year."

   Explanation: "That of" should refer to a singular noun. 
     Since "profits" is plural, "those of" is the correct phrase to use.

    2. Unclear Reference
   - Incorrect: "Her opinion was different from that of the others."
   - Correct  : "Her opinion was different from that of the other students."

   Explanation: The phrase "that of" should clearly refer to a specific noun. 
   In the incorrect sentence, "the others" is too vague. 
   Specifying "the other students" clarifies the comparison.

    3. Redundant Use
   - Incorrect: "The strategy of the new company is similar to that of the strategy of the old company."
   - Correct  : "The strategy of the new company is similar to that of the old company."

   Explanation: The phrase "that of" already implies a comparison with the same type of noun (strategy), 
                so repeating "the strategy" is redundant.

    4. Using "That of" with Incompatible Nouns
   - Incorrect: "The color of the sky is different from that of blue."
   - Correct  : "The color of the sky is different from that of the ocean."

   Explanation: "That of" should compare like NOUNS. 
     Here, "blue" is an adjective, not a noun, so it doesn't match with "color.
	 " The correct comparison is between "the color of the sky" and 
	 "the color of the ocean."

    5. Misplaced "That of"
   - Incorrect: "The design that of the house is unique."
   - Correct  : "The design of the house is unique."

   Explanation: "That of" is unnecessary here because 
   there’s NO COMPARISON being made. 
   The sentence should be simplified by removing "that of."

    6. Overuse or Misuse in Simple Comparisons
   - Incorrect: "My car is faster than that of my brother's car."
   - Correct  : "My car is faster than my brother's car."

   Explanation: The sentence structure is too complex for a 
   simple comparison. "That of" is not needed when you can 
   directly compare the two items.

    7. Incorrect Noun Usage After "That of"
   - Incorrect: "The responsibilities of a manager are heavier than that of employees."
   - Correct  : "The responsibilities of a manager are heavier than those of employees."

   **Explanation: "That of" should be used with singular nouns. 
   Since "responsibilities" is plural, "those of" should be used instead.

    8. Inconsistent Singular/Plural Agreement**
   - Incorrect: "The opinions of the committee differ from that of the general public."
   - Correct  : "The opinions of the committee differ from those of the general public."

   Explanation: "Opinions" is plural, so the correct phrase should be "those of," not "that of."
